# ProceduralPaintingTool

A tool for creating, for now, biomes on a terrain.

This is using GLFW and glad.

I am using dear_ImGUI for UI, which is just added into the project itself.
Same goes for wavefront, which is used to generate meshes from OBJ files.
For image loading, I am using stb_image, which also is included in the project.

For includes and libraries, please check the Dependencies folder.

The movement is done with Urneal ENgine controls.
HOld Right Mouse BUtton and then move with WASD. to go higher you hold RMB and press Space and for lowering it is Left Control.
